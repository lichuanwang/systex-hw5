== Lottery and Guess Game Web Application

=== Project Overview

This is a web application that features two games:

1. *Lottery Game*: Players can generate random lottery numbers while excluding certain numbers.
2. *Guess Game*: Players can guess a number between 1 and 10, and they are given a limited number of tries to guess
   the correct number.

The web application is built using *Java* and *JSP*, following the *Model-View-Controller (MVC)* pattern. It runs
on *Apache Tomcat* and is managed using *Maven*.

---

==== 1. Lottery Game

In the lottery game, you can generate random lottery numbers. You can specify how many groups of numbers you want to
generate and exclude certain numbers from the results.

1. Input Values:
    1. *Number of Groups (組數)*: Input the number of groups of lottery numbers you want to generate (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    2. *Exclude Numbers (排除)*: Enter the numbers you want to exclude from the lottery results (e.g., 5, 12, 23).
       Separate multiple numbers with spaces or commas.
2. Click Submit to generate your lottery numbers. The application will display the results, excluding the numbers you
   specified.

Example Input:

    Number of Groups: 3
    Exclude Numbers: 12, 23, 45

Example Output:

    Lottery Set 1: [5, 8, 19, 24, 32, 48]
    Lottery Set 2: [7, 14, 26, 31, 37, 42]
    Lottery Set 3: [3, 9, 18, 27, 33, 40]

==== 2. Guess Game

===== Overview:

In the guess game, you need to guess a number between 1 and 10. You have a limited number of tries (3 attempts by
default) to guess the correct number.

1. Input Values:
    1. *Your Guess*: Input a number between 1 and 10.
    2. Click Submit to submit your guess. The application will respond by telling you whether your guess is correct or
       incorrect. It will also show how many attempts you have remaining.
    3. If you guess correctly, you’ll be redirected to a “You Win” page. If you run out of attempts, you’ll see a “Game
       Over” page.

Example Input:

    Your Guess: 7

Example Output:

    Incorrect Guess: “Number of Attempts Remaining: 2”
    Correct Guess: “Congratulations! You’ve guessed the correct number.”

== Introduction to Postman and cURL

=== What is Postman?

Postman is a popular API development tool that simplifies the process of creating, testing, and documenting APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface to send HTTP requests, inspect responses, and automate API testing workflows.

==== Key Features of Postman:
- *Request Building*: Postman allows you to easily build and send HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., to interact with APIs.
- *Collections*: You can organize your API requests into collections and folders, making it easy to group related requests.
- *Environment Variables*: Postman supports environment variables, enabling dynamic substitution of values in your requests based on the environment (e.g., production, testing, development).
- *Automated Testing*: Postman includes built-in support for writing tests using JavaScript, allowing you to automate API testing.
- *Collaboration*: You can share your collections with your team and collaborate on API development and testing.

==== Getting Started with Postman:
1. *Install Postman*: Download and install Postman from https://www.postman.com/downloads/[https://www.postman.com/downloads/].
2. *Create a Request*: Open Postman and create a new request. Select the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) and provide the API endpoint URL.
3. *Send a Request*: Add headers, parameters, and body as needed. Click "Send" to make the request and view the response.
4. *Test the Response*: Use Postman's testing feature to write test scripts that validate the API's response.

=== What is cURL?

cURL is a command-line tool that enables you to transfer data over various protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. It is often used to interact with APIs and is pre-installed on many operating systems.

==== Key Features of cURL:
- *Command-line Interface*: cURL operates directly from the command line, making it lightweight and easy to script.
- *Protocol Support*: cURL supports a variety of protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and SFTP.
- *Request Types*: You can perform various types of requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- *File Uploads/Downloads*: With cURL, you can upload and download files from a remote server.
- *Headers and Authentication*: cURL allows you to pass custom headers, authenticate requests, and handle cookies.

==== Getting Started with cURL:

1. *Check Installation*: Most operating systems come with cURL pre-installed. To check, run the following command in your terminal:

[source,bash]
----
curl --version
----

2. *Make a Request*: To make a basic GET request, use the following command:

[source,bash]
----
curl https://api.example.com/data
----

3. *POST Request with Data*: To send a POST request with JSON data, use:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/data -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key": "value"}'
----

4. *Include Headers*: You can include custom headers in your request like this:

[source,bash]
----
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" https://api.example.com/data
----

=== Conclusion:

Both Postman and cURL are powerful tools for interacting with APIs, each with its strengths. Postman is ideal for those who prefer a graphical interface and built-in testing, while cURL is perfect for command-line enthusiasts and automation scripts. Depending on your needs, you can use either tool effectively for API development and testing.
